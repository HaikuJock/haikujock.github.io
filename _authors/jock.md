I'm Jock and I've been programming computer games since I was 12 years old. I worked professionally in the games industry for nine years and subsequently for eight years as a software engineer developing iOS and Android apps. I started working on Dwerg Saga in my spare time in December 2017 and left my job to work on it full time in September 2019.
