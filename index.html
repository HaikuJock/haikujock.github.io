<h1>Play. Build. Know Yourself.</h1>

<p>
    In Dwerg Saga you play as the chief of a clan starting a new home in the wilderness. See dramatic and believable stories develop from the interactions between Dwergs, their environment and what they build. The personality of your chief is determined by your scores on a personality test. We hope Dwerg Saga will teach you something about yourself by showing how your chief behaves in dramatic situations.
</p>
<p>
    Dwerg Saga is in development, currently it is a voxel sandbox with a handful of mining and building tools. Agents take part in rudimentary conversations but nothing dramatic is happening yet.
