<h2>More about Dwerg Saga</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to Dwerg Saga and a world of deep storytelling. Guide your clan of Dwergs as they establish a new home in the untamed wilderness. Watch as they forge friendships, sing tales of their forefathers, suffer the pangs of unrequited love, take up arms and seek adventure wherever you take them.
</p>
<p>
    Dwerg Saga aims to create dramatic and believable stories from the interactions between agents, their environment and what they build. The personality of the player's avatar is determined by the player's scores on a personality test. The game aspires to teach players something about themselves by involving their avatar in dramatic situations. Players interact with a persistent shared world that is mapped to the real world. As well as playing privately, players can simultaneously play together with others in their vicinity. Dwerg Saga is being designed with usability as a key feature so it's easy to pick up and play anywhere and anytime.
