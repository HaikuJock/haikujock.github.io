-   Stairs are Built
-   Personality affects gameplay
-   New Build Tool

At Levels café again on Saturday I do a bit of roadmap planning and sketch out the next three releases. I start making stairs always be build jobs instead of a combination of mining and building. After a walk up Arthur Seat on Sunday morning I shelve the stairs work because I'm supposed to be just doing house-keeping and bug-fixes this week.

From Monday through Wednesday, in preparation for planning, I start writing a gameplay effect for every personality facet. There are 320 facets and I get about a fifth of the way through that, creating new tasks to support effects that are not currently possible. I intend to write these down and then review for feasibility and gameplay value.

From Athena's feedback I am merging the Build, Stairs, Farm and Workshop tools under a single Build tool. I make mock-ups on Thursday (see pictures) and organise the Keyboard Options which naturally leads back into working on the Build Tool.

​We did not do the retrospective and planning but Athena will be back for her last day next week to test the new Build Tool.
