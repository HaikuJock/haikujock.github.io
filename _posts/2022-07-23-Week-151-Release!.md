At Levels on Saturday afternoon I get to playtest an early build of [The Enjenir](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1800940/The_Enjenir/). This has come a long way since I saw it last and it's as fun to watch as it is to play. A number of simple, humorous missions teach the basics and it looks like there are already a number of maps each with their own missions.

I fix two of the simpler bugs I found on Friday but the crash I found occurs when a synch occurs in networked games where the host is a dedicated server. This bug was introduced in version 0.18 but the fix is straightforward and I have a fix in by the end of Sunday.

I'm continuing to work through the test-plan on Monday but take some time in the evening to play the game for fun and find a couple of small bugs with building latrines. Completing the test-plan on Tuesday I do the upgrade-path testing in the afternoon and make the release on Wednesday.

I've taken a few days off but will be back to planning the next large piece of work on Monday.
