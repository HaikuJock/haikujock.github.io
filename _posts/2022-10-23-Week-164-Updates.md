-   Networked fixes
-   Demo update
-   Release update

Testing the networked game on Saturday and I am able to move Dwergs from other clans and no one's going to like that. It's a straightforward fix but then I find the Equip button in the Inventory doesn't work and I don't think it has ever worked in networked games. I take a break on Sunday and the release goes without a hitch on Monday.

Now that tools work with the left-mouse button instead of the right, and after being prodded about access to a demo I've released the previous version as the demo.

Finally, I've released a small update to the main app to prevent looking at Hidden terrain.

For the next week I'll be at [Roguelike Celebration](https://www.roguelike.club/) and [Scottish Games Week](https://gamesweek.scot/).​
