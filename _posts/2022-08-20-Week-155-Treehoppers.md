-   Sound effects
-   Nests

I get back to work on Sunday with adding a new enemy. I was going to add giant spiders until [Rao Dao Zao](https://raodaozao.net/) pointed out they are terribly cliched. I want a territorial creature living in forests that will slowly reproduce and eventually encroach on the player. I thought Grasshoppers might work but renaming them Treehoppers to indicate they are huge. Then I find [Treehoppers are real](https://www.google.com/search?q=treehoppers&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMrbX8yMb5AhX1_rsIHcZuBL8Q_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1858&bih=977&dpr=1) and they are so much more terrifying.

With the Treehopper sprite complete I move on to the audio. Each animal has four sounds; idle, attack, injured and death. Sourcing cricket, squishing, crunching and chittering recordings from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/), editing in Audacity, I add Treehopper, Copperpede and Flintworm sounds.

I want the Treehoppers to occupy forests and periodically spawn from nests. I've underestimated this work but decide it will make for some interesting gameplay, so I may end up moving some other work into a later release.

For the next week I'll be finishing the Treehoppers, foreshadowing future threats and adding wandering enemies.​
