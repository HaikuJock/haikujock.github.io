This week has been mostly about making an iOS app that allows me to modify in-game constants while the game is running. The idea for this really came from [Lazer Walker](https://twitter.com/lazerwalker)'s [GroundKontrol](https://github.com/lazerwalker/GroundKontrol) that uses a MIDI controller to tweak Unity constants. Check out her [excellent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aXrLvdrnao&t=23m51s) [talks](https://youtu.be/stM33UcLPJ0) to understand why this is a good thing.

[Fluctuface](https://github.com/HaikuJock/Fluctuface) is available on GitHub and I even made a pre-release NuGet package for the [client library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Haiku.Fluctuface). This is really in the prototype stage but it does what I need it to do so I'm going to go back to the bronze-working on Dwerg Saga for the next week.

I watched  an excellent talk by [Victoria Tran](https://twitter.com/TheVTran) from [Kitfox Games](https://www.kitfoxgames.com/en) on [making better communities](https://youtu.be/oWsIfgx0yps). I've taken the first step and added rules to the Dwerg Saga Discord.

My brain was tickled by this [Veritasium video on tiling](https://youtu.be/48sCx-wBs34). I like the fact that the Penrose tiling is non-repeating but only uses two shapes.

I dropped in on a few PAX talks last month and particularly enjoyed the [panel on procedural generation](https://youtu.be/ZERuH_hbCH4), I couldn't find it at the time, but the video is now on YouTube.

I've been reading [Procedural Storytelling in Game Design](https://www.routledge.com/Procedural-Storytelling-in-Game-Design/Short-Adams/p/book/9781138595309). Great stuff!
