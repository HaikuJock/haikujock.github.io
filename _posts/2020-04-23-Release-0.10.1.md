* Fix crash on launch

Version 0.10 crashed on launch on both Mac and Windows when it was packaged. On Mac this was due to FMOD not finding the native dylibs despite them being in the same folder as all the other dylibs. I suspect this was the same problem on Windows but trying to debug a UWP app that takes five minutes to build was driving me nuts so I'm dropping the UWP version and going back to Win32. While doing that I thought it would be nice to use [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to make an installer on the build pipeline.

Release 0.10.1 is now available for $3 patrons on [itch.io](https://haikuinteractive.itch.io/dwerg-saga/patreon-access).
